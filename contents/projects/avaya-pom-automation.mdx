# 🧪 Avaya POM Automation Testing

**Role:** QA Automation Engineer  
**Tech:** Java • Selenium WebDriver • TestNG • Cucumber (BDD) • Maven • Jenkins  
**Domain:** Contact Center / Outbound Campaign Automation

## 📝 Overview

Avaya Proactive Outreach Manager (POM) is an outbound automation system used to make auto-dial calls, send SMS, and email to customers.  
In this project, I built a full automation testing framework to:

- Test the POM Manager web interface
- Automate the creation and execution of outbound campaigns
- Test Contact Strategy flows and retry rules
- Validate dashboard & real-time campaign monitoring
- Verify dialer modes, call results, and integration with Avaya AEP

This automation suite reduced manual testing effort by **70%** and improved stability for large-scale outbound campaigns.

## 📚 BDD Scenarios (Sample)

```gherkin
Feature: Create outbound campaign
  As an admin user
  I want to create an outbound campaign
  So that the system can start dialing automatically

  Scenario: Successfully create a new campaign
    Given I login to POM Manager as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Campaign Management"
    And I create a new outbound campaign with name "AutoCampaign01"
    And I upload customer list "customer-data.csv"
    Then the campaign "AutoCampaign01" should appear in campaign list
```
