## 📘 Introduction

This is my personal website built from scratch since **November 2025** using modern technologies like **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.

I use this platform to:

The site is continuously evolving. You’re welcome to fork or explore the source code. If you find it helpful, consider giving it a ⭐ on GitHub.
